            "content": "It seems like the issue you're encountering in `ListeningTotalsComp.jsx` is related to the asynchronous nature of state updates in React, as well as the dependency array of the `useEffect` hook. When you call `setMinutesTotal`, it schedules a state update, but the component does not re-render immediately. This means the `minutesTotal` variable does not have the updated value when you try to use it right after setting it.\n\nHere's what's happening in your current code:\n\n- You execute `sqlDb.exec(totalMinListenedQuery)` and immediately set the result to `minutesTotal` using `setMinutesTotal`.\n- Right after setting `minutesTotal`, you check if it's greater than 0, but at this point, `minutesTotal` has not been updated yet because state updates are asynchronous.\n- The `useEffect` hook only runs again when `sqlDb` or `year` changes, not when `minutesTotal` changes.\n\nTo fix this, you should use the result of `sqlDb.exec(totalMinListenedQuery)` directly instead of relying on the `minutesTotal` state variable. Here's the corrected `executeListeningTotals` function:\n\n```jsx\nconst executeListeningTotals = () => {\n    const res = sqlDb.exec(totalMinListenedQuery);\n    const minutesTotalResult = res[0].values[0][2];\n    setMinutesTotal(minutesTotalResult);\n    if (minutesTotalResult > 0) {\n        const totalDurationCalc = `${Math.floor(minutesTotalResult / (24 * 60))} days, ${Math.floor((minutesTotalResult % (24 * 60)) / 60)} hours, ${minutesTotalResult % 60} minutes`;\n        console.log('totalDurationCalc in executeListeningTotals:', totalDurationCalc);\n        console.log('now should dispatch setUserTotals with minutesListened:', totalDurationCalc);\n        dispatch(setUserTotals({minutesListened: totalDurationCalc}));\n        setTotalDuration(totalDurationCalc);\n    }\n};\n```\n\nAdditionally, you should ensure that the `useEffect` hook runs once when the component mounts. This can be achieved by having an empty dependency array:\n\n```jsx\nuseEffect(() => {\n    if (sqlDb) {\n        console.log('reduxReady true in ListeningTotalsComp');\n        console.log('year in ListeningTotalsComp, useEffect:', year);\n        console.log('firstYear in ListeningTotalsComp, useEffect:', firstYear);\n        executeListeningTotals();\n    }\n}, [sqlDb]); // Removed 'year' from the dependency array to run only on mount and when sqlDb changes\n```\n\nLastly, make sure that the `ListeningTotalsComp` component is properly connected to the Redux store and that the `sqlDb` is initialized before the component mounts. If `sqlDb` is not ready when the component mounts, the `useEffect` won't run the `executeListeningTotals` function, and you won't see the total duration until a refresh or a state change occurs.\n\nWith these changes, the total duration should display when the site first loads, and also update correctly when the year changes.",
